## Part 1: Connect to a Store

## Tasks
[x] You've been provided starter code to work with - `app-state-connect`
[x] Connect `index.js` to the redux store and pass it down to the `App` component
[x] Remove the state declaration in the constructor
  [x] Do you still need a constructor? if it's a function no, if it's a component maybe?
[x] Bring in the actions to `app.js`
[x] Map state and dispatch to props in `app.js`
  [x] use `stuff` as your state keyword.
[x]  Export the connected `App` component
[x]  Render `this.props.stuff.foo` instead of `this.state.foo`
[x] Remove the `handleChange()` method in `app.js`
[x] Re-Implement the click event on the `<div>` using the action method that you mapped earlier
